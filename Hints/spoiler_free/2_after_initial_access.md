Make sure you gained access to one Azure user before continuing here. 

The pointer to further progress lies in answering these questions:
1. How do I log in to the Azure management portal, and the command line interfaces?
2. How to enumerate for accessible resources, groups, users, and so on after gaining initial access?

After answering the above, you should be able to see what the target to get to the next step is.

*Hints* for progression:
- The resource in front of you has an "obvious" critical vulnerability. (We do intend to make it less obvious in future though!)
- With the vuln, impersonate the thing in front of you, somehow?
