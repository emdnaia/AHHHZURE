Good job! And what's next? Again, the path to the next step lies in the questions below:
1. How do I log in with access tokens?
2. Are there different kinds of access tokens for different target resources? (Of course there are.)
2. Again, how to enumerate for accessible resources, groups, users, and so on after gaining access to an identity?

After the above are answered, you should be able to see what the target to get to the next step is.

*Hints* for progression:
- If you have obtained access to the resource required to progress, it should be obvious what to do with it.
