Hi! Welcome to the spoiler free hints for AHHHZURE. 

I do believe starting here is how you can get the most out of this vulnerable deployment.
If you are stuck at any point, feel free to check out the spoiler hints as well. 

In a real engagement, all you get starting out is the client's company name. Now that you have spun up a tenant, you already have access to the domain name. In an engagements you may look for valid users' names with OSINT, here you can check out `users_no_spoiler.txt` instead. Here's some pointers to get started:

1. How to validate an Azure tenant's name and domain externally?
2. How to enumerate for valid user emails once domain is confirmed?

*Hints*: 
- After performing the above, your way in for initial access would either be password based attack or storage container enumeration.
- Microburst and Msolspray are some repo to potentially look at, in this stage of compromise. Feel free to explore other tools as well!
